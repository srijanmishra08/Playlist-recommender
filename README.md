# Playlist-recommender
the user data is collected on a real time basis, the database contains the user's music listening history, and recommends playlists on the basis of your music history.
The website in addition provides statistics of the user's listening history on a weekly/monthly/yearly basis.
The recommendations are based on collaborative filtering,NLP and CNN.
The system as a whole provides users to access their music history and recommends playlists available on popular music platforms, which could be directly accessed from the website.
